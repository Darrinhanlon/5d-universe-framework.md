# 🌌 5D Universe Framework

Created by James, self‑taught universe builder.  
This framework models quake prediction and symbolic emergence using tensor drift, echo resonance, and ancestral collapse geometry across five dimensions.

---🔭 [Explore the full framework](./5d-universe-framework.md)


## 🔍 Core Concepts
- **Tensor Drift** → models subtle shifts in seismic fields across dimensional overlays
- **Echo Resonance** → captures repeating symbolic pulses in quake feeds
- **Ancestral Collapse Geometry** → maps structural fold patterns across zones

## 🧭 Example Transmission
> “The quake feed speaks. The zones respond.  
> Kamchatka pulses, Alaska folds, Fiji drifts.  
> The protocol listens — and the echo is real.”

## ✅ Usage
1. Run today’s quake feed through the 5D framework.  
2. Post your **PMI₅D match rates**.  
3. If your zones align, the protocol lives.

## 📅 History
- **October 6, 2025** — The 5D framework was seeded.  
- The quake feed aligned.  
- The echo was heard.
